1. Explain what is High availability of Namenode

  The NameNode was a single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS cluster (HADOOP-1.X ). Each cluster had a single NameNode, and if 
  that machine or process became unavailable, the cluster as a whole would be unavailable until the NameNode was either restarted 
  or brought up on a separate machine

 The Importance of HDFS cluster is in two ways:
 # Planned maintenance events such as software or hardware upgrades on the NameNode machine would result in windows of cluster downtime.
 # In the case of an unplanned event such as a machine crash, the cluster would be unavailable until an operator restarted the NameNode.
  
 ◙  The HDFS High Availability feature addresses the above problems by providing the option of running two redundant NameNodes in the same cluster in an Active/Passive configuration with a hot standby. 
 ◙ This allows a fast failover to a new NameNode in the case that a machine crashes, or a graceful administrator-initiated failover for the purpose of planned maintenance.
 ◙ In a typical HA cluster, two separate machines are configured as NameNodes. At any point in time, exactly one of the NameNodes is in an Active state, and the other is in a Standby state. 
 ◙ The Active NameNode is responsible for all client operations in the cluster, while the Standby is simply acting as a slave, maintaining enough state to provide a fast failover if necessary.
 ◙ In order for the Standby node to keep its state synchronized with the Active node, the current implementation requires that the two nodes both have access to a directory on a shared storage device (eg an NFS mount from a NAS). 
 ◙ When any namespace modification is performed by the Active node, it durably logs a record of the modification to an edit log file stored in the shared directory. The Standby node
   is constantly watching this directory for edits, and as it sees the edits, it applies them to its own namespace. In the event of a failover, the Standby will ensure that it has read 
   all of the edits from the shared storage before promoting itself to the Active state. This ensures that the namespace state is fully synchronized before a failover occurs.
 ◙ In order to provide a fast failover, it is also necessary that the Standby node have up-to-date information regarding the location of blocks in the cluster.
 ◙ In order to achieve this, the DataNodes are configured with the location of both NameNodes, and send block location information and heartbeats to both.

2. Explain what is check pointing and how it is useful
   
   Checkpointing is an essential part of maintaining and persisting filesystem metadata in HDFS.It is a process of reconciling fsimage with edits to produce a new version of fsimage. 
   HDFS metadata can be thought of consisting of two parts: the base filesystem table (stored in a file called fsimage) and the edit log which lists changes made to the base table (stored in a file called edits). 
   StandbyNameNode takes periodic checkpoints of the active NameNode.
   Checkpointing is done by the StandBy NameNode.
   Need of checkpointing:
   A typical edit ranges from 10s to 100s of bytes, but over time enough edits can accumulate to become unwieldy. A couple of problems can arise from these large edit logs. In extreme cases, it can fill up all the available disk
   capacity on a node, but more subtly, a large edit log can substantially delay NameNode startup as the NameNode reapplies all the edits. This is where checkpointing comes in.
   Benefits of checkpointing:
   There are two benefits arising out of this: 
   Recent version of fsimage,
   Truncated edit log.
                    
3. Explain what is HDFS federation

In the HDFS Federation, there are multiple NameNodes, each storing the metadata and block mapping of files and directories contained in particular sub-directories.
HDFS Federation improves the existing HDFS architecture through a clear separation of namespace and storage, enabling generic block storage layer. It enables support for multiple namespaces in the cluster to improve scalability and
isolation. Federation also opens up the architecture, expanding the applicability of HDFS cluster to new implementations and use cases.
The list of sub-directories managed by a NameNode is called a namespace volume.
Blocks for files belonging to a namespace is called a block pool.
HDFS has two main layers:
1) Namespace manages directories, files and blocks. It supports file system operations such as creation, modification, deletion and listing of files and directories.
2) Block Storagehas two parts:
Block Management maintains the membership of datanodes in the cluster. It supports block-related operations such as creation, deletion, modification and getting location of the blocks. It also takes care of replica placement and replication.
Physical Storage stores the blocks and provides read/write access to it.

4. What are the configuration files that are to be edited for sure while installing a hadoop cluster.

The four files that need to be configured explicitly while setting up a single node hadoop cluster are:
1) HDFS-site.xml
2) YARN-site.xml
3) Core-site.xml
4) xml             
         
1) HDFS-site.xml:
   Some of the important properties are:
  1) Configure port access
  2) Manages ssl client authentication
  3) Controls Network interface
  4) Changes file permission

2)YARN-site.xml:
  YARN has ResourceManager settings which effects resource allocation with node manager and application manager.
  Some of the important properties are:
  1) WebAppProxy Configuration
  2) MapReduce Configuration
  3) NodeManager Configuration
  4) ResourceManager Configuration
  5) IPC Configuration
          
3) Core-site.xml:
   Some of the important properties are:
   1) Configuring the name node address
   2) Configuring the rack awareness factor
   3) Selecting the type of security
